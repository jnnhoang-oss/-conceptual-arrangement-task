      <p>
        In this experiment, you will be using the mouse to click and drag placeholders (representing images) around the screen. 
        At the beginning, you will press the <b>spacebar</b> to start, and a set of colored boxes will appear on the left side of the screen. 
        It will be your job to drag and drop those boxes into the circular arena on the right, and arrange them so that the more conceptually 
        similar items are placed closer together, and the more dissimilar items are placed farther apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can move each placeholder as many times as youâ€™d like to make sure that the arrangement corresponds to the conceptual similarity.
